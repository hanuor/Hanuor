##### Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile

* * *

I'm currently working as a Tech lead and a founding member of Digifynd (https://digifynd.com) and PeakPerformer (https://peakperformer.io).

I started my career as a designer that morphed into an instructor where I developed an online course on Android for my (then) current employer - Internshala. A few weeks later I was then promoted to the position of a Full-stack + mobile app developer.

I have experience with mobile technologies, full-stack web development and a bit of ML)

Oh and yeah, I'm also an active stock market trader.

\- Greyplate (https://greyplate.com) - Greyplate is an online link aggregator service which provides you to wrap up all your links into a personalized landing page. I started working on the idea in November'19 and launched the platform on product hunt. Greyplate was the top trending products list for about a week on Product Hunt. In March'20 I booked an exit after a US-based entrepreneur made a compelling offer to buy the website. **My overall return on investment was 2062%.**
